Write a program that takes the following costs between nodes
and determines (calculates and prints) the routing table at a given node. 
You program
should prompt for the user to specify the node of interest.
Assume that the costs are the same in each direction. For example, if the 
cost
from A-> B is 3, it follows that the cost from B to A is also 3.
